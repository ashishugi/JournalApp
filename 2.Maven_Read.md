<h1>Maven</h1>


1. Maven: 
   1. Used to make build
   2. Used to manage dependencies.
2. LifeCycle of maven:
   1. Clean: removes target folder/Jar.
   2. Validate: validate if project is correct.
   3. Compile: compile the source code
   4. test: run unit test
   5. package: take compiled code and package it into JAR/WAR as per configured. Jar is made inside target.
   6. verify: runs integrations test and ensure quality criteria are met.
   7. install: install the package into local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally. Our jar will be store in the local `.m2` repository to usage in other local repositories.
   8. deploy: done in build environment, copies the final package to remote repository
3. We simply use: `mvn validate` or `mvn compile` etc. to run above commands. If you do not have mvn install you can simply use a .mvnw file created ex: `./mvnw validate` or `./mvnw compile` etc.
